## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the homepage of the Avertable Burden Project Github Organisation. This resource is a collection of GitHub repositories relating to the development, testing and deployment of tools to predict the budren of mental disorders that is potentially averable under selected healthcare intervention regimes.

It is important to note that as the project is currently in an early planning phase and as such all content in these repositories should be regarded as pre-release, in-development placeholder content, established purely for helping to plan development infrastructure.
